# Those-Who-Came
First Unity game made in 2022.3.9f1. Went pretty well, I am proud of it.

I used quite a lot of assets from the asset store as I am not personally skilled enough to be creating my own models and textures.
The game was created for an assignment in my college course; but, the game comes under the definition for a game and offers replayability, so I am posting it here.

Here are some images from the game:

Please feel free to download and enjoy my first game.

If you feel like exploiting the wacky FPS Controller, sprinting and crouching at the same time for some reason increases the player's base speed by an unknown large factor each time.
